tirtosCfg_common_solution

The TI SimpleLink RTOS projects use a separate, dependent project to contain the
RTOS kernel. This kernel project is then referenced by TI-RTOS projects to
provide kernel services.

The tirtosCfg common project is our workshop's answer to the common kernel
project created by TI. In essesence, we just took TI's kernel project and
modified it with the changes needed for our lab solutions.
